# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

This is an **ALX School**  project on conditionals, loops and functions on python.

The source code has to follow certain rules:

## For Python Scripts
 * First line should be
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
```
 * Code should use [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style.
 * Should end with new line.
 * Must be executable.

## For C Scripts
 * Scripts will be compiled with:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
```
 * Code should use Betty style.
 * No global variables.
 * No more than 5 functions per file.
 * All function headers should be included in the header file(**lists.h**).
